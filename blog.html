              <p>Elegant. Proud. Clever. The <span>Poodle</span> is an impressive dog, as the many best-in-show winners from this dog breed can attest. But behind the blue ribbons, <span>impressive hairdos, and regal</span> attitude, you’ll find an affectionate family dog with an ancient history and many talents.Poodles are regarded as one of the most intelligent breeds in the world. They’re highly trainable and well suited for just about any task you put them to — and you will want to give them tasks to do. Bored Poodles can get destructive if they aren’t physically and mentally stimulated. But active owners who can meet their dog’s needs will find a loving, smart, trainable, and loyal family companion.

              <p>The <span>Siberian Husky</span> dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia. It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but beware because this <span>athletic, intelligent</span> dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents. Huskies also put the “H” in Houdini and need a yard with a high fence that goes all the way into the ground to prevent escapes. Giving your Husky enough exercise may prove easier said than done; though, it’ll reduce boredom and unwanted behaviors, like escape attempts.</p>

              <p>The <span>Border Collie</span> dog breed was developed to gather and control sheep in the hilly border country between Scotland and England. They’re known for their intense stare, or “eye,” with which they control their flock. They’re dogs with <span>unlimited energy, stamina, and working drive</span>, all of which make them a premier herding dog; Border Collies are still used today to herd sheep on farms and ranches around the world.Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.</p>

              <p>Originally bred to hunt, haul sledges, and herd reindeer, the <span>Samoyed</span> dog breed proved a valuable companion for northwestern Siberia’s Samoyede people. Among the breed’s duties: pack hiking, tracking, and warming their owners by sleeping on top of them at night. As a working breed, Samoyeds can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain <span>friendly, gentle, and devoted family</span> dogs. They’re affectionate with almost everyone, so long as new people don’t mind some shedding and stray hairs on their clothes.</p>
